          FastFold, folding optimization              *FastFold* *fastfold*

===========================================================================
0. Introduction ~
                                          *FastFold-intro* *fastfold-intro*

Automatic folds - that is, folds generated by a fold method different
from `manual` - bog down VIM considerably in insert mode. Also, they are often
re-evaluated prematurely for example, when inserting an opening fold marker
whose closing counterpart has yet to be added to complete the fold.

See http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Keep_folds_closed_while_inserting_text
for a discussion.

With this plug-in, the folds in the currently edited buffer are updated when
certain triggers are met:
- when saving the buffer
- when closing or opening folds (zo, za, zc, etc...)
- when moving or operating fold-wise (zj,zk,[z,]z)
- when typing `zuz` in normal mode

===========================================================================
1. Commands ~
                                    *FastFold-commands* *fastfold-commands*
                                                          *FastFoldUpdate!*

- `:FastFoldUpdate` updates all folds in the current buffer.
- `:FastFoldUpdate!` updates all folds & echoes what fold method was used

- The mapping `zuz` that invokes `:FastFoldUpdate!` can be changed to your
  favorite keystroke, say `<F5>`, by adding
>
    nmap <F5> <Plug>(FastFoldUpdate)
<
  to your `.vimrc`. It can be disabled by adding
>
    nmap <SID>(DisableFastFoldUpdate) <Plug>(FastFoldUpdate)
<
===========================================================================
2. Config ~
                                        *FastFold-config* *fastfold-config*

Each of the above triggers can be enabled or disabled by setting the
matching global flags in your `.vimrc`. Default values are shown.
>
  nmap zuz <Plug>(FastFoldUpdate)
  let g:fastfold_savehook = 1
  let g:fastfold_fold_command_suffixes =  ['x','X','a','A','o','O','c','C']
  let g:fastfold_fold_movement_commands = [']z', '[z', 'zj', 'zk']
<
For example, by adding the following  to your `.vimrc`
>
  set foldmethod=syntax

  let g:tex_fold_enabled=1
  let g:vimsyn_folding='af'
  let g:xml_syntax_folding = 1
  let g:php_folding = 1
  let g:perl_fold = 1
<
You will enable tex, vim, xml, php and perl syntax folding.

-----------------------------

- By default FastFold updates all fold when you open or close folds by
  zx, zX, za, zA, zo, zO, zc, zC. This is configured by the variable
>
  let g:fastfold_fold_command_suffixes =  ['x','X','a','A','o','O','c','C']
<
  If you wanted to intercept all possible fold commands (such as zr,zm,...),
  change this to:
>
  let g:fastfold_fold_command_suffixes =
  ['x','X','a','A','o','O','c','C','r','R','m','M','i','n','N']
<
- By default FastFold updates all fold when you move or operate fold-wise by
  the commands zj,zk,[z or ]z. This is configured by the variable
>
  let g:fastfold_fold_movement_commands = [']z', '[z', 'zj', 'zk']
<
-----------------------------

The option
>
  let g:fastfold_force = 0
<
when set to 1, enables FastFold even for foldmethods other than 'syntax' and
'expr'. Because these other fold methods require little computation, there is
little benefit in forcing manual folds by FastFold, thence the default value '0'.

===========================================================================
3. Extra Notes ~

3.1 Warnings ~

Note: This plug-in will overwrite your manual folds when saving the
currently edited buffer, unless you either

- explicitly tell this plug-in to refrain from it via `g:fastfold_skipfiles`, a
  list of regular expressions against which the current file name is matched,
  or
-  the local `foldmethod` has been `manual` since entering the buffer.

3.2 API ~

The last used fold method by which FastFold updates the folds in the current
buffer can be read off from the window local variable `w:lastdfm`.

3.2 Related Plugins ~

`FastFold` integrates with both `vim-stay` and `restore_view.vim` that both
store and restore the last folds by `:mkview` and `:loadview`. How they
compare is discussed at

https://github.com/kopischke/vim-stay/issues/2

Note that `restore_view.vim` integrates only from version 1.2 and above and
must load AFTER `FastFold`. (To ensure the correct autocmd execution order.)
------------------------------

A `CustomFoldText()` function that displays the percentage of the number of
buffer lines that the folded text takes up and indents folds according to
their nesting level is available at

http://www.github.com/Konfekt/FoldText
